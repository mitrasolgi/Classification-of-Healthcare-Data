When for the same instance, we have two class labels, we do the following:

Cleaning policy 1:

If #Yes==#No (INCONSISTENCY, TIE) then remove all the instances that have this criteria.

If #Yes > #No (INCONSISTENCY, has MAJORITy), then remove all the inctances that have this criteria but keep ONE "Yes" instance.

If #No > #Yes (INCONSISTENCY, has MAJORITy), then remove all the inctances that have this criteria but keep one "No" instance.


Cleaning policy 2 (cleaner way)

If #Yes==#No (INCONSISTENCY, TIE) then remove ALL the instances that have this criteria.

If #Yes > #No (INCONSISTENCY), then remove ALL the inctances that have this criteria.

If #No > #Yes (INCONSISTENCY), then remove ALL the inctances that have this criteria.


Cleaning policy 3:

1) Merge training + testing: 
2) Apply policy 2
